# What did you try?
I tried the convolutional neural network to solve this problem. Specifically, I tried to add a small number of convolutional filters such as 16, as well as a large number such as 128. Also, I tried to repeat the convolution and pooling process for multiple times. Finally, I tried to add more neural units.

# What worked well?
I found that the more layers, the convolution and pooling process and neural units I add, the more accuracy the model will be. Meanwhile, the more above things are added, the more time training the model will take.

# What didnâ€™t work well?
As long as I did not change the number of neural units, the result will not really change because of the number of filters I applied.

# What did you notice?
Through above point, I learned that the number of neural units are the most significant parameters I need to take into consideration.
